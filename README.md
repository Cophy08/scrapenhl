# scrapenhl
Scraping and manipulating NHL PbP Data

This package contains tools for scraping and analyzing NHL data. It is a rewrite of [some of my earlier code](https://github.com/muneebalam/Hockey).

In the future, you will be able to install from pip:

```
pip install scrapenhl
```

Dependencies include pandas, numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn. 

To install all of them easily, you can use [Anaconda](https://docs.continuum.io/).
